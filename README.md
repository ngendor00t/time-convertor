# time-convertor
this is a python program that solves three toy problems
it starts by creating the three files then adding .py at the end of the file so that it could be executed as python 
## positives.py
this file executes digits that are greater that 0
i used conditional flow conditonal flow i  sloving the problem the if and else where if the statement is true it gives certain value if not it gives an otherwise value which is false 
we take a function pass values a parameter 
and pass the actual value as tghe argument


## Time convetor
the second file is dealing with solving a problem of time conversion from 24-12 hrs or am to pm 
i defined a fumction and gave it the hour and passed a time string to it
checked if there were digits and words in the time string
then placed my work in conditional statements
where if it wasnt in  12 hours system it returns in 24hrs


## constants
it takes a strings and checks the consonant substrings alphabets that are not vowels
takes a variable and checks and removes the vowels
